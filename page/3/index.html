  <div class="entry-content"><p>今天twitter的速度很慢，总是出现延迟现象。于是改到这边话痨发作。</p>

<p>其实还是开始用新东西的新鲜劲儿。</p>

<p>但生活不可能总是新鲜，总要习惯八成满的稳定。我希望自己可以学会安然的细水长流，可又有种隐隐的恐惧，所谓的安然，只是不得不接受现实的黯然。</p>

<p>又或许，根本没必要想得那么明白，装糊涂也是门大智慧。</p>

<p>今天把头发扎成一束，还带了条发箍，把刘海都压到脑袋后面。大家都说我这么梳头发很利落，不过明天还是继续散着吧，三九天的，保暖很重要。</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>今天看到的第一条推，感觉很默契——周末到了，心情很好。</p>

<p>今晚据说boss要请饭，有点不太想去，累得慌，很想回家睡觉，前几天下大雪，房里地板踩得很脏，也一直没时间拖干净。</p>

<p>其实说穿了，就是缺少归属感，总觉得有一天要离开，下意识地游离于一切组织活动之外，懒得掺和。</p>

<p>貌似下午四点又要下雪，这次的天气预报竟然精确到小时，很是让人刮目。不过无论准确与否，晚高峰的地铁，一定又是人满为患了。现在为止，这是鼓舞我参加晚上饭局的最大
动力。</p>

<p>这几天忙的脾气有点暴躁，常常缺少耐心。告诉自己，深呼吸，越是着急的事情，越要慢慢来做。</p>

<p>我想我是有点害怕。我以为我足够勇敢，但其实还是会怕。至于怕的是什么，to be actually，我并不想知道得太清楚。</p>

<p>一贯的鸵鸟作风，把头埋进沙子里，然后告诉自己，世界很小，我很快乐。</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>零下十八度的夜晚，听着外面的风声，没有电，屋里漆黑一片，很冷……种种巧合加在一起，快乐立刻变成一件很容易实现的事。</p>

<p>例如，我有两床暖和的被子；我的笔记本还有70%的电量，足够我用到睡觉；暖气虽然只是温的，但它起码可以在没电的前提下正常运作；怕黑的时候，有人会跟我讲没关系，

<p>今天的雪很大，人们一早出来，带着帽子和手套，呵斥呵斥的在路边铲雪，身上还冒着蒸腾的白气，很像记忆里小时候的冬天，正宗的北方的冬天。那时我们经常打雪仗，我的技

<p>今天又是连滚带爬的一天。做听众的时候，觉得这份工作毫无技术含量。真正走进幕后才发现，突发状况无处不在，只有想不到，没有不可能。</p>

<p>大王老师今天发喜糖，扒拉半天，没找着我想吃的，倒是袋子很漂亮，抢回家来，可以包花瓣熏衣服用。说起花瓣，好久没买花了，甚至于好久都没去过超市了。白玫瑰最适合做
香包，配这个红色的小袋应该也很和谐，或者下次也可以试试用粉玫瑰搭配紫罗兰。</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>记得高中有一次上课间操，原因已经想不起来了，事件就是不知道那位仁兄惹毛了年级主任，结果全班被罚跑圈，300米一圈的操场，一步没停地跑了两节课。真是全靠年轻火
力壮啊，没用如我，连跑90分钟，居然还能存活下来。现在光是念叨一下，那份想象中的艰难就足以要了我的老命。</p>

<p>anyway，这个不是重点。我的point其实是想说一种怪异的生理反应，很多时候大脑发出的指令明明是哭，结果却莫名其妙的笑了出来。就像那次跑圈，在第N次路过
篮球架时，我决定下个圈跑到这里，一定要嚎啕大哭，必要时综合利用在地上打滚、装病以及其他一切能想到的手段，用无赖形象免掉无休止的苦役。于是，酝酿情绪到第N+1
次路过篮球架，万事俱备，连眼眶都湿润了，结果一张嘴竟然笑了出来。这一笑不仅毁了悲壮的气氛，也泄掉了最后一口气，两条腿更是迈不动了。</p>

<p>从那次开始，我发现，自己在哭和笑上的条件反射常常陷于紊乱。就像眼前这一秒，太多的不确定让人恐惧，看着时间像指缝里流走的沙，有那么多话想对他说，偏偏开不了头。
在幻想中，此时此刻，我已然哗哗大哭。</p>

<p>而事实呢？坐在桌前，一脸镇定的敲字，打肿脸充胖子，然后被自己气笑，然后骂自己是阿Q，然后还成功分清了当年阿Q只要了茴香豆，许三观点的才是2两黄酒和一碟炒肝儿
。omg，思维说好听了是奔腾的野马，说难听点根本就是撒了一地的崩豆儿，完全失去控制。</p>

<p>从小就和男生争惯了，不习惯被人看到我哭。所以现在真的想哭了，唯一能做的，却只剩下笑了。</p>

<p>其实早就知道，那些话问与不问，答案都在心里明明白白的刻着。只是，在真切听到的一瞬间，到底还是难过了。</p>

<p>whatever，这是一个充满混乱的胡言乱语的夜晚，允许自己小小抽风一下吧，把一切都推给荷尔蒙异常分泌。</p>

<p>只要感情真实存在，我就会尊重并坚持下去。自己的决定，过程再委屈，也没什么可抱怨的。呵呵，我上辈子一定欠了他很多很多钱吧。</p>

<p>tomorrow is another day. just smile.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>限于技术问题，很久没看到这个页面了，话痨生涯也被迫中断。现在终于回来了，又不知道该写些什么。很多事都是这样，在过长的等待中耗尽力气。于是一千零一遍告诉自己，
做个有勇气坚持的人。</p>

<p>09年盘点，记忆劳损，抑或是刻意忘却，总之有大段大段的空白。翻翻以前的日志，又都想起来了。有几篇看的很开心，也有几篇，今天仍然不敢翻开，原来快乐和痛楚都长存

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Prepared Remarks of President Barack Obama</p>

<p>Back to School Event</p>

<p>Arlington, Virginia</p>

<p>September 8, 2009</p>

<p>The President: Hello everyone – how’s everybody doing today? I’m here with
students at Wakefield High School in Arlington, Virginia. And we’ve got
students tuning in from all across America, kindergarten through twelfth
grade. I’m glad you all could join us today.</p>

<p>I know that for many of you, today is the first day of school. And for those
of you in kindergarten, or starting middle or high school, it’s your first day
in a new school, so it’s understandable if you’re a little nervous. I imagine
there are some seniors out there who are feeling pretty good right now, with
just one more year to go. And no matter what grade you’re in, some of you are
probably wishing it were still summer, and you could’ve stayed in bed just a
little longer this morning.</p>

<p>I know that feeling. When I was young, my family lived in Indonesia for a few
years, and my mother didn’t have the money to send me where all the American
kids went to school. So she decided to teach me extra lessons herself, Monday
through Friday – at 4:30 in the morning.</p>

<p>Now I wasn’t too happy about getting up that early. A lot of times, I’d fall
asleep right there at the kitchen table. But whenever I’d complain, my mother
would just give me one of those looks and say, &#8220;This is no picnic for me
either, buster.&#8221;</p>

<p>So I know some of you are still adjusting to being back at school. But I’m
here today because I have something important to discuss with you. I’m here
because I want to talk with you about your education and what’s expected of
all of you in this new school year.</p>

<p>Now I’ve given a lot of speeches about education. And I’ve talked a lot about
responsibility.</p>

<p>I’ve talked about your teachers’ responsibility for inspiring you, and pushing
you to learn.</p>

<p>I’ve talked about your parents’ responsibility for making sure you stay on
track, and get your homework done, and don’t spend every waking hour in front
of the TV or with that Xbox.</p>

<p>I’ve talked a lot about your government’s responsibility for setting high
standards, supporting teachers and principals, and turning around schools that
aren’t working where students aren’t getting the opportunities they deserve.</p>

<p>But at the end of the day, we can have the most dedicated teachers, the most
supportive parents, and the best schools in the world – and none of it will
matter unless all of you fulfill your responsibilities. Unless you show up to
those schools; pay attention to those teachers; listen to your parents,
grandparents and other adults; and put in the hard work it takes to succeed.</p>

<p>And that’s what I want to focus on today: the responsibility each of you has
for your education. I want to start with the responsibility you have to
yourself.</p>

<p>Every single one of you has something you’re good at. Every single one of you
has something to offer. And you have a responsibility to yourself to discover
what that is. That’s the opportunity an education can provide.</p>

<p>Maybe you could be a good writer – maybe even good enough to write a book or
articles in a newspaper – but you might not know it until you write a paper
for your English class. Maybe you could be an innovator or an inventor – maybe
even good enough to come up with the next iPhone or a new medicine or vaccine
– but you might not know it until you do a project for your science class.
Maybe you could be a mayor or a Senator or a Supreme Court Justice, but you
might not know that until you join student government or the debate team.</p>

<p>And no matter what you want to do with your life – I guarantee that you’ll
need an education to do it. You want to be a doctor, or a teacher, or a police
officer? You want to be a nurse or an architect, a lawyer or a member of our
military? You’re going to need a good education for every single one of those
careers. You can’t drop out of school and just drop into a good job. You’ve
got to work for it and train for it and learn for it.</p>

<p>And this isn’t just important for your own life and your own future. What you
make of your education will decide nothing less than the future of this
country. What you’re learning in school today will determine whether we as a
nation can meet our greatest challenges in the future.</p>

<p>You’ll need the knowledge and problem-solving skills you learn in science and
math to cure diseases like cancer and AIDS, and to develop new energy
technologies and protect our environment. You’ll need the insights and
critical thinking skills you gain in history and social studies to fight
poverty and homelessness, crime and discrimination, and make our nation more
fair and more free. You’ll need the creativity and ingenuity you develop in
all your classes to build new companies that will create new jobs and boost
our economy.</p>

<p>We need every single one of you to develop your talents, skills and intellect
so you can help solve our most difficult problems. If you don’t do that – if
you quit on school – you’re not just quitting on yourself, you’re quitting on
your country.</p>

<p>Now I know it’s not always easy to do well in school. I know a lot of you have
challenges in your lives right now that can make it hard to focus on your
schoolwork.</p>

<p>I get it. I know what that’s like. My father left my family when I was two
years old, and I was raised by a single mother who struggled at times to pay
the bills and wasn’t always able to give us things the other kids had. There
were times when I missed having a father in my life. There were times when I
was lonely and felt like I didn’t fit in.</p>

<p>So I wasn’t always as focused as I should have been. I did some things I’m not
proud of, and got in more trouble than I should have. And my life could have
easily taken a turn for the worse.</p>

<p>But I was fortunate. I got a lot of second chances and had the opportunity to
go to college, and law school, and follow my dreams. My wife, our First Lady
Michelle Obama, has a similar story. Neither of her parents had gone to
college, and they didn’t have much. But they worked hard, and she worked hard,
so that she could go to the best schools in this country.</p>

<p>Some of you might not have those advantages. Maybe you don’t have adults in
your life who give you the support that you need. Maybe someone in your family
has lost their job, and there’s not enough money to go around. Maybe you live
in a neighborhood where you don’t feel safe, or have friends who are
pressuring you to do things you know aren’t right.</p>

<p>But at the end of the day, the circumstances of your life – what you look
like, where you come from, how much money you have, what you’ve got going on
at home – that’s no excuse for neglecting your homework or having a bad
attitude. That’s no excuse for talking back to your teacher, or cutting class,
or dropping out of school. That’s no excuse for not trying.</p>

<p>Where you are right now doesn’t have to determine where you’ll end up. No
one’s written your destiny for you. Here in America, you write your own
destiny. You make your own future.</p>

<p>That’s what young people like you are doing every day, all across America.</p>

<p>Young people like Jazmin Perez, from Roma, Texas. Jazmin didn’t speak English
when she first started school. Hardly anyone in her hometown went to college,
and neither of her parents had gone either. But she worked hard, earned good
grades, got a scholarship to Brown University, and is now in graduate school,
studying public health, on her way to being Dr. Jazmin Perez.</p>

<p>I’m thinking about Andoni Schultz, from Los Altos, California, who’s fought
brain cancer since he was three. He’s endured all sorts of treatments and
surgeries, one of which affected his memory, so it took him much longer –
hundreds of extra hours – to do his schoolwork. But he never fell behind, and
he’s headed to college this fall.</p>

<p>And then there’s Shantell Steve, from my hometown of Chicago, Illinois. Even
when bouncing from foster home to foster home in the toughest neighborhoods,
she managed to get a job at a local health center; start a program to keep
young people out of gangs; and she’s on track to graduate high school with
honors and go on to college.</p>

<p>Jazmin, Andoni and Shantell aren’t any different from any of you. They faced
challenges in their lives just like you do. But they refused to give up. They
chose to take responsibility for their education and set goals for themselves.
And I expect all of you to do the same.</p>

<p>That’s why today, I’m calling on each of you to set your own goals for your
education – and to do everything you can to meet them. Your goal can be
something as simple as doing all your homework, paying attention in class, or
spending time each day reading a book. Maybe you’ll decide to get involved in
an extracurricular activity, or volunteer in your community. Maybe you’ll
decide to stand up for kids who are being teased or bullied because of who
they are or how they look, because you believe, like I do, that all kids
deserve a safe environment to study and learn. Maybe you’ll decide to take
better care of yourself so you can be more ready to learn. And along those
lines, I hope you’ll all wash your hands a lot, and stay home from school when
you don’t feel well, so we can keep people from getting the flu this fall and
winter.</p>

<p>Whatever you resolve to do, I want you to commit to it. I want you to really
work at it.</p>

<p>I know that sometimes, you get the sense from TV that you can be rich and
successful without any hard work &#8211; that your ticket to success is through
rapping or basketball or being a reality TV star, when chances are, you’re not
going to be any of those things.</p>

<p>But the truth is, being successful is hard. You won’t love every subject you
study. You won’t click with every teacher. Not every homework assignment will
seem completely relevant to your life right this minute. And you won’t
necessarily succeed at everything the first time you try.</p>

<p>That’s OK.  Some of the most successful people in the world are the ones
who’ve had the most failures. JK Rowling’s first Harry Potter book was
rejected twelve times before it was finally published. Michael Jordan was cut
from his high school basketball team, and he lost hundreds of games and missed
thousands of shots during his career. But he once said, &#8220;I have failed over
and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>These people succeeded because they understand that you can’t let your
failures define you – you have to let them teach you. You have to let them
show you what to do differently next time. If you get in trouble, that doesn’t
mean you’re a troublemaker, it means you need to try harder to behave. If you
get a bad grade, that doesn’t mean you’re stupid, it just means you need to
spend more time studying.</p>

<p>No one’s born being good at things, you become good at things through hard
work. You’re not a varsity athlete the first time you play a new sport. You
don’t hit every note the first time you sing a song. You’ve got to practice.
It’s the same with your schoolwork. You might have to do a math problem a few
times before you get it right, or read something a few times before you
understand it, or do a few drafts of a paper before it’s good enough to hand
in.</p>

<p>Don’t be afraid to ask questions. Don’t be afraid to ask for help when you
need it. I do that every day. Asking for help isn’t a sign of weakness, it’s a
sign of strength. It shows you have the courage to admit when you don’t know
something, and to learn something new. So find an adult you trust – a parent,
grandparent or teacher; a coach or counselor – and ask them to help you stay
on track to meet your goals.</p>

<p>And even when you’re struggling, even when you’re discouraged, and you feel
like other people have given up on you – don’t ever give up on yourself.
Because when you give up on yourself, you give up on your country.</p>

<p>The story of America isn’t about people who quit when things got tough. It’s
about people who kept going, who tried harder, who loved their country too
much to do anything less than their best.</p>

<p>It’s the story of students who sat where you sit 250 years ago, and went on to
wage a revolution and found this nation. Students who sat where you sit 75
years ago who overcame a Depression and won a world war; who fought for civil
rights and put a man on the moon. Students who sat where you sit 20 years ago
who founded Google, Twitter and Facebook and changed the way we communicate
with each other.</p>

<p>So today, I want to ask you, what’s your contribution going to be? What
problems are you going to solve? What discoveries will you make? What will a
president who comes here in twenty or fifty or one hundred years say about
what all of you did for this country?</p>

<p>Your families, your teachers, and I are doing everything we can to make sure
you have the education you need to answer these questions. I’m working hard to
fix up your classrooms and get you the books, equipment and computers you need
to learn. But you’ve got to do your part too. So I expect you to get serious
this year. I expect you to put your best effort into everything you do. I
expect great things from each of you. So don’t let us down – don’t let your
family or your country or yourself down. Make us all proud. I know you can do
it.</p>

<p>Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America.</p>
